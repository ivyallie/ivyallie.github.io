<h2>What is Monograph?</h2>
<p><b>Monograph</b> is "the magazine of non-sequential cartooning." It is a not-for-profit publication showcasing gag cartoons,
    one-panel comics, and spot illustrations. The magazine's mission is to provide a fun, low-stakes venue in which
cartoonists can publish work. It's not for glory or for money, it's for the sake of the drawings!</p>
<p>The premier issue of <em>Monograph</em> is currently <b>open for submissions</b>. Read on below for the full
submission guidelines, and when you're ready, drop a line to <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
<p><em>Monograph</em> accepts submissions of finished work or pitches in the following categories:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Single-panel gag cartoons.</b> As seen in <em>The New Yorker</em>, this is typically a
        humorous drawing with a caption (usually a line of spoken dialogue) written below it.</li>
    <li><b>Single-panel comics.</b> A cartoon formatted like a gag cartoon, but not intended to be funny.
        It could be a “slice of life,” surreal, or poetic. Experiment and try new things!</li>
    <li><b>Spot illustrations.</b> Fun little drawings that might not have a home anywhere else: selections
        from your sketchbooks, nice doodles made during a boring meeting, or anything in between.</li>
    <li><b>Public-domain artwork.</b> <em>Monograph</em> is interested in raising the profile of lesser-known artists of the
        past. If you can provide reproduction-quality scans of artwork that’s out of copyright
        (or where it’s possible that permission might be obtained from rights holders), please feel free to submit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that at present <em>Monograph</em> is intended as a black-and-white publication, so color artwork is not ideal,
    though you should feel free to submit it anyway, with the understanding that it probably won’t be reproduced
    in full color.</p>
<p><em>Monograph</em> is not interested in submissions of:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Sequential comics.</b> They’re great, but that’s not what this magazine is for. If it has more than one panel,
        don’t send it to <em>Monograph</em>.</li>
    <li><b>Poetry and prose.</b> Probably goes without saying, but this is a visual art magazine. There are plenty of
        poorly-compensated venues for poetry and prose already.</li>
    <li><b>AI-generated art.</b> <em>Monograph</em> is strictly "by humans, for humans."</li>
    <li><b>“Edgy” or lewd humor.</b> The gag cartoon has a history in <em>Playboy</em> and other “men’s magazines”, but
        <em>Monograph</em> is not interested in work that exists primarily to titillate or shock.</li>
</ul>

<p>All clear? Great! Send your submissions to <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

<h2 id="nonprofit">Not-for-profit: how and why</h2>
<p>A not-for-profit model allows <em>Monograph</em> to be reproduced and distributed for very little money, while still compensating
the artists who contribute to it. Any revenue exceeding the magazine's cost of production is distributed to its
contributors on a per-page basis.</p>
<p>For example, if Contributor A has two pages in a twenty-page issue, the breakdown might look something like this
    (values are for illustration purposes only):</p>
<ul>
    <li>One copy of the magazine is sold at the cover price of <b>$8</b></li>
    <li>The copy's cost of production is <b>-$2.50</b></li>
    <li>The credit gained from the copy is <b>$5.50</b></li>
    <li>Contributor A is responsible for 10% of the issue's content, so they get <b>$0.55</b> per copy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contributors will also have the option to purchase copies from the publisher at cost (so in the above example,
$2.50 per copy), or to print copies themselves, which they can then sell and price however they like, keeping any profit.</p>

<p>Granted, you're not going to make much money publishing work in <em>Monograph</em>. But the compensation is <em>fair</em>.
You get your share of whatever money is made, and the publisher keeps only enough to cover the cost of materials and shipping.
Because it's not about the money, it's about collaborating on a fun little publication we can all enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="copyright">Copyright and licensing</h2>
<p>Contributors grant <em>Monograph</em> the non-exclusive right to reproduce their work in the context of the issue in which
    it runs, and extend to their fellow contributors the right to continue to reproduce the artwork in
    the context of additional copies of the issue. </p>

<p>Contributors retain any and all rights to their work outside of the context of the magazine.</p>

<p>In the spirit of collaborative art, <em>Monograph</em> encourages its contributors to consider non-copyright licenses, but
standard copyright is OK too if that's what you like!</p>



<h2 id="publisher">Who is doing this?</h2>
<p>The mysterious “publisher” is Ivy Lynn Allie, who will likely produce the magazine on her personal laser printer.
    Ivy will also serve as the editor of the publication. <em>Monograph</em> will be published under her Hexagon Books label.</p>
