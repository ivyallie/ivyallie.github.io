        <p>I'm Ivy! I'm a cartoonist and writer, currently living in Los Angeles.
            I'm an alumna of the Center for Cartoon Studies class of 2021.</p>
        <p>Most of my work is in <a href="/comics/">comics</a> these days, but you can also find me <a href="/words/">writing</a>
        about a variety of topics. I mostly keep off of social media but I post pretty frequently on
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ivylynnallie/">Instagram</a> and ramble about movies on <a href="https://letterboxd.com/ivyallie/">Letterboxd</a>.</p>
        <p>Outside of my art and writing, I work professionally in computer graphics and software development.</p>
        <p>When I'm not doing any of these things, I may be found cooking (always vegetarian, usually Indian),
        reading, walking in the woods, or playing the theremin.</p>
