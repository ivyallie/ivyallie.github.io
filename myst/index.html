<h2>Frequently Asked Question</h2>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Why do you always refer to the player character as "she"?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> I don't. I refer to the player character as "she" half of the time and "he" the other half
of the time. However, this has not stopped many people from asking this question and were I to put this through
another round of editing I think I would take a different approach.</p>
