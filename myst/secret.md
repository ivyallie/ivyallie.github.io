You solved the secret fireplace code! I hope you had as much fun cracking it as I had putting
it together. Your reward, such as it is: some selections from my sketchbook revealing the process
behind the illustrations. It's not much, but like Atrus, I don't have much to offer (and I'm afraid
my drawing cannot wait). But send me an email (via the address at the bottom of the page) and I
would be happy to add your name to the roster of people who have solved the puzzle, granting you a very 
trivial (but real!) bit of internet fame.

![Sketches for Mechanical Age illustration](/assets/images/myst/secret/mechanical_sketches.gif)
Rough sketches for Mechanical Age illustration. My concept for this image was to greatly increase
the number of gears scattered on the ground, but first I had to figure out how to draw piles of gears.
I also sketched some barnacles for the rail supports, but I don't think they're really visible in
the final version of the illustration.

![Sketches for Teledahn illustration](/assets/images/myst/secret/teledahn_sketch.gif)
Rough sketches for Teledahn illustration. I was inspired by the high density of the mushrooms
in the old Mudpie concept art moreso than the way the Age appeared in the released game.

Unused concept thumbnails for Remaking of Myst chapter. My first idea was to draw a rainy Stoneship
in a nod to the original _realMyst_.

Working out how to draw the Great Zero. On the left, a full-size rough sketch with perspective
guides added. On the right, a refinement drawn on tracing paper over the rough.

![Thumbnails and reference photo for Kadish statue](/assets/images/myst/secret/kadish_statue.jpg)
Thumbnailing composition for the Kadish statue from the Fourth Sphere, and making a fool
of myself to get a photo reference to draw from. That's a stock pot serving as the globe.
I had to stand on a chair to get high enough above the camera.

Rough sketch for the Stoneship telescope. The perspective on this one was a real challenge but
I'm pleased with how it turned out.
