<h2 id="horizon_line">The Horizon Line</h2>
<p>Let's begin with the humblest
    of all drawing elements:
    the horizon line.</p>
<img src="images/horizon.gif" alt="A horizon line"/>
<figure>
    <figcaption>The horizon line is <strong>relative to the viewer's eye level</strong>. This means
        that it can be used to determine the relative heights of objects.
    </figcaption>
    <img src="images/horizon_relative.gif" alt="Three boxes demonstrating height relative to a horizon line"/>
</figure>

<figure>
    <figcaption>If a character's eyes are level with the horizon line, the character is the
        same height as the viewer (assuming they're standing on the same level)
    </figcaption>
    <img src="images/horizon_relative_characters.gif"
         alt="Three simple characters demonstrating height relative to a horizon line"/>

</figure>


<div class="columnar">
    <figure>
        <figcaption>You can use any two converging
            lines to locate the horizon. The
            point where the lines meet is
            where the horizon line should be.
        </figcaption>
        <img src="images/horizon_convergence.gif"
             alt="A square with converging edges indicating the position of the horizon"/>

    </figure>
    <figure>
        <figcaption>Edges that run parallel to the
            ground always meet at the
            horizon line.
        </figcaption>
        <img src="images/horizon_convergence2.gif" alt="A square with edges converging toward the horizon"/>

    </figure>
</div>


<figure>
    <figcaption>It's important to determine the position of the horizon line as early
        as possible... otherwise you may find you've drawn angles that
        converge at different horizon lines:
    </figcaption>
    <img src="images/horizon_contradict.gif"
         alt="A box with edges that incorrectly converge toward two different horizon lines"/>

</figure>


<p>If this happens, all you can do is pick one of them, then correct the
    nonconforming lines. Remember: <strong>lines converge toward the
        horizon!</strong> There are exceptions to this which will be covered later on,
    but it's still the most important principle of perspective drawing.</p>

    center represents the vanishing point (VP).</figcaption>

    at the same vanishing point.</figcaption>

<figure>
        <figcaption>We can use horizontal lines to align objects in single-point
    perspective. In this example, the two farther doors are aligned
    with each other, while the two closer doors are not.</figcaption>
    <img src="images/sp_alignment.gif" alt="A digram showing how objects can be aligned in space under single-point perspective" />

</figure>

<p>Single-point perspective is nice because it's <strong>easy</strong>. It's incredibly
    simple to determine any angle using nothing but a ruler.</p>
<p>
    But don't think that just because it's simple that it's useless. In fact,
    I would argue that you should consider it your default—why
    overcomplicate things? In many cases single-point perspective is all
    you really need.</p>

<h3>Single-point perspective: Examples</h3>
<figure class="captioned_example">
    <img src="images/sp_burns.gif" alt="A single-point perspective drawing from Last Look by Charles Burns"/>
    <figcaption>Single-point perspective can
    be used to direct the eye to a
    specific point in space. In this
    example by Charles Burns,
    the converging lines all point
    to the door, and the long
    uninterrupted edges of the
    planks imply the path that the
    character is about to take.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="captioned_example">
    <img src="images/sp_little.gif" alt="A single-point perspective drawing from Motel Art Improvement Service by Jason Little"/>
    <figcaption>Here, Jason Little uses a
    classic steeply-converging
    single-point perspective
    combined with a low eye
    level to create a dramatic
    and disorienting effect. This
    composition also draws
    attention toward the man
    with the briefcase.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="captioned_example">
    <img src="images/sp_telgemeier.gif" alt="A single-point perspective drawing from Ghosts by Raina Telgemeier" />
    <figcaption>In most single-point
    compositions the vanishing
    point is within the frame,
    but this drawing by Raina
    Telgemeier provides a
    nice counterexample. The
    converging lines still draw
    the eye toward the VP, which
    in this case means that they
    "guide" the character into
    the open space in the upper
    part of the panel.</figcaption>
</figure>


<h2 id="two-point">Two-Point Perspective</h2>

<figure>
    <figcaption>The horizon line is back—now with two vanishing points!</figcaption>
    <img src="images/horizon_twopoint.gif" alt="A horizon line with two vanishing points marked"/>
</figure>
<p>Two-point perspective works much like single-point
    perspective, but now both left-to-right axes converge.</p>

<figure>
    <figcaption>Let's say this vertical line is the edge of a box:</figcaption>
    <img src="images/two_point_angles01.gif" alt="A horizon line with two vanishing points marked, intersected by a vertical line" />

</figure>

<figcaption>Find the angles for the left side by tracing to the left vanishing point:</figcaption>
    <img src="images/two_point_angles02.gif" alt="Using a ruler to find an angle for two-point perspective." />

<figcaption>Again, for the right:</figcaption>
    <img src="images/two_point_angles03.gif" alt="Using a ruler to find an angle for two-point perspective." />
</figure>

<figure>
<figcaption>A box!</figcaption>
    <img src="images/two_point_angles04.gif" alt="A box drawn in two-point perspective." />
</figure>
<h3>Two-Point Perspective: Examples</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="images/tinderbox.gif" alt="An illustration in two-point perspective from The Tinderbox by Ivy Allie" />
    <figcaption>In this example from my own
    work, steep angles of convergence
    contribute to the sensation of a
    small, cramped space.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure class="captioned_example">
    <img src="images/herge01.gif" alt="An illustration in two-point perspective from Cigars of the Pharaoh by Herge"/>
    <figcaption>Here, Hergé uses vanishing
    points well beyond the edges
    of the composition. The resulting
    shallow angles of convergence
    show that the city is still some
    distance away.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="captioned_example">
    <img src="images/lutes01.gif" alt="An illustration in two-point perspective from Berlin by Jason Lutes"/>
    <figcaption>Jason Lutes uses
    two-point perspective very
    effectively to create solid,
    believable architecture.
    Like the previous example,
    converging lines are
    nearly parallel, creating a
    "compressed" effect similar to
    that of a telephoto lens.</figcaption>
</figure>


<h2 id="three-point">Three-Point Perspective</h2>
<p>In three-point perspective,
    vertical lines are no
    longer perpendicular
    to the horizon. Instead,
    they converge toward a
    third point located either
    above or below the
    horizon. All three axes
    now converge!</p>
<img src="images/three-point.gif" alt="A gridded box drawn in three-point perspective"/>
<p>Three-point perspective
    is most useful when
    drawing a viewpoint
    that's looking upward or
    downward, especially
    when tall objects are
    involved.</p>
<p>But three-point perspective isn't your only option for drawing these
    kinds of views. Depending on the subject, you may be able to save
    yourself some trouble and use two-point or single-point to achieve
    similar effects:</p>
<figure class="captioned_example">
    <img src="images/city_twopoint.gif" alt="A 'fake' three-point perspective that is actually two-point"/>
    <figcaption>Here, a modified two-point perspective
    is used to create a "worm's-eye view" of a
    city street. Instead of converging toward the
    horizon, things converge toward a vertical
    line that runs through the middle of the
    composition. The two vanishing points are
    on this line.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="captioned_example">
    <img src="images/city_singlepoint.gif" alt="A 'fake' three-point perspective that is actually single-point"/>
    <figcaption>And here, the
    classic "looking
    down at the city
    street" effect is
    accomplished
    using single-point
    perspective!</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Three-Point Perspective: Examples</h3>
<div class="columnar">
    <figure>
    <img src="images/brown01.gif" alt="An example of three-point perspective from I Never Liked You by Chester Brown"/>
    <figcaption>Chester Brown uses three-point
    perspective to create a dramatic sense of
    depth that also directs the eye toward the
    car. Brown's lines are drawn freehand, which
    makes me think he may also be finding the
    angles by instinct rather than defining specific
    vanishing points.</figcaption>

</figure>
<figure >
    <img src="images/lutes02.gif" alt="An example of three-point perspective from Berlin by Jason Lutes" style="max-height:50em; max-width:fit-content;"/>
    <figcaption>Jason Lutes draws a top-down view of a stairwell in three-point
    perspective. Don't try this at home, kids!</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>


<figure>
    <p>Here, Raina Telgemeier uses a "fake" three-point perspective. Lengthwise and
    heightwise the benches converge toward points on a vertical "horizon" but
    widthwise do not converge.</p>
    <img src="images/telgemeier01.gif" alt="An example of 'fake' three-point perspective from Ghosts by Raina Telgemeier"/>

<h2 id="ellipses">Ellipses</h2>
<p>Ellipses are circles drawn in perspective. Drawing a good ellipse isn't
    easy, but the principles behind them are fairly simple.</p>
<ol class="drawing_steps small_img" >
    <li>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/ellipse01.gif" alt="A square drawn in perspective with diagonal lines indicating its center point"/>
            <figcaption>Begin with a square drawn in perspective, then add two
        diagonal guides to find its center. </figcaption>
        </figure>
    </li>
    <li>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/ellipse02.gif" alt="A square drawn in perspective with vertical and horizontal guidelines drawn through its center point"/>
                <figcaption>Draw vertical and
        horizontal guides through the center point. (Don't forget
        to align them with the corresponding vanishing points as
        needed!) The points where these lines meet the edge of
        the square will also be where the ellipse touches it.
    </figcaption>
        </figure>
    </li>
    <li>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/ellipse03.gif" alt="A square drawn in perspective with the beginning of a sketch of an ellipse inside it" />
            <figcaption>Begin sketching in the curves
    of the ellipse. It can be helpful
    to start from the guideline
    intersections and work from
    there, but it's not mandatory.</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </li>
    <li>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/ellipse04.gif" alt="A square drawn in perspective with a sketch of an ellipse inside it" />
<figcaption>Continue sketching until you
    have filled out a consistent-
    looking curvature all around.
    Don't erase after mistakes, just
    add more marks until you have
    a sense of the correct form.
<aside>Note: Because ellipses are
    receding in space, they are
    not symmetrical!

        <li>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/ellipse05.gif" alt="A drawing of an ellipse" />
<figcaption>Finally, do your best to freehand an ellipse that follows
    the curve you worked out. It can be useful to do the
    preparatory work on a separate sheet of paper and then
    transfer with tracing paper or a lightbox.</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </li>

</ol>

<p>There's no way around it—drawing ellipses is hard. My advice: don't
    expect to get them right on the first try. Assume that you will have to
    experiment and clean up. If your process includes the computer, don't
    be shy about using digital ellipse tools if that's what it takes. You can
    also buy a set of plastic ellipse templates, but they're expensive.</p>
<aside class="ellipse_mistakes">
    <p>Beware of the two most
        common ellipse mistakes:</p>
    <div class="columnar">

    <img src="images/ellipse_lemon.gif" alt="An incorrectly-drawn 'lemon' ellipse"/>

        </figure>
    </div>
</aside>

<h2 id="placing_points">Placing Your Vanishing Points</h2>
<p>The positioning of vanishing points relative to your scene affects how
    space is distorted in your drawing.</p>
<p></p>
<figure>
    <figcaption>Points that are
    close together
    increase distortion:</figcaption>
    <img src="images/placing_vps_01.gif" alt="An illustration showing how distortion increases when vanishing points are close together"/>

</figure>
<figure>
    <figcaption>Moving the left
    point further away
    gives a more
    naturalistic look:</figcaption>
    <img src="images/placing_vps_02.gif" alt="An illustration showing how distortion increases when vanishing points are further apart."/>
</figure>

<p>(Moving the right point, or
    both points, would have
    worked just as well)</p>
<p>Once you know how the positioning of a vanishing point affects
    distortion, you can use that knowledge to estimate the vanishing
    points from a rough sketch.</p>

<figure>
    <figcaption>Let's say we want a building
    that looks roughly like this:</figcaption>
    <img src="images/vp_placement_sketch.gif" alt="A simple sketch used as a reference for vanishing point placement."/>

</figure>

<figure>
    <figcaption>To achieve the same effect, the left vanishing point should be close to
    the building, and the right vanishing point should be far away:</figcaption>
     <img src="images/vp_placement_from-sketch.gif" alt="Vanishing points placed following the previous sketch as a guide."/>
</figure>


<p>Just about right, but this also brings us to a recurring problem with
    multi-point perspective, namely:</p>
<h2 id="beyond_edge">What To Do When Your Vanishing Point Is Beyond the Edge of the Page</h2>
<p>This is perhaps the most frequent bugaboo of perspective drawing.
    Luckily there are a few ways to address it.</p>
<figure>
   <figcaption>By far the easiest method is to tape down extra pieces of paper and
    draw the vanishing points on them. Use a long ruler to connect the
    lines. Usually I find that the distances aren't so far away as to make
    this entirely impractical. It looks stupid and messy but trust me, if you
    can make this work it will make things easier for you in the long run.</figcaption>
    <img src="images/beyond_edge.gif" alt="Extending your paper to find vanishing points beyond the edge."/>
</figure>

<p>Another method is to make a study drawing at a smaller size, then
    enlarge it once you've figured out all the critical angles. You can use
    a copying machine for this (and I highly recommend having a good
    scanner-printer in your studio).</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could work with a perspective grid, as seen in the
    next section!</p>

<h2 id="grid">Creating a Perspective Grid</h2>
<p>Another option for situations in which the vanishing point is off the
    page is to construct a perspective grid to use as a guide instead. I find
    using a perspective grid to be more difficult than aligning directly from
    a vanishing point, but some people like them and maybe you will too!
    This technique for constructing a grid is sometimes called the Brewer
    Method and was popularized in the book <a href="https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=30949701798"><em>How to Draw</em> by Scott
    Robertson with Thomas Bertling.</a></p>
<ol class="drawing_steps">
    <li>
        <figure>

    <img src="images/brewer01.gif" alt="First step in the Brewer Method" />
   <figcaption>These three lines are the basis of our
    grid. You can adjust the angles of
    the lines as needed as long as the
    lines all converge toward a horizon.
    We don't know where that horizon
    is yet, but the two lines on the right
    converge somewhere. So the first step is to find the upper left line that
    will converge with the lower left line at the same horizon.</figcaption>
</figure>
    </li>
    <li>
        <figure>
        <img src="images/brewer02.gif" alt="Second step in the Brewer Method" />
<p>Add a vertical line between the two
    right-hand lines. Place it as far as
    possible from the other vertical line.</p>
</figure>
    </li>
    <li>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/brewer03.gif" alt="Third step in the Brewer Method" />
<figcaption>Create a rectangle using this new
    vertical. The lower left corner of the
    rectangle is placed at the point where
    it intersects the lower left line.</figcaption>
</figure>
    </li>
    <li>
        <figure>
        <img src="images/brewer04.gif" alt="Fourth step in the Brewer Method" />
<figcaption>Now we know the correct angle for
    the upper left line­­ –from the top of the
    vertical through the upper-left corner
    of the rectangle! Were you to extend
    the left and right lines, they would
    converge on the same horizon.</figcaption>
</figure>
    </li>
    <li>

<figure>
        <img src="images/brewer05.gif" alt="Fifth step in the Brewer Method" />
<figcaption>Divide each vertical line into some
    number of equal segments. To do
    this you'll need to measure the lines
    and calculate the length of the
    subdivisions. I recommend using
    centimeters for this operation­—
    much easier to measure out!</figcaption>

    </li>
    <li>
           <figure>
        <img src="images/brewer06.gif" alt="Final step in the Brewer Method" />
<figcaption>Now draw lines from the division
    points on the left and right verticals
    through the corresponding
    divisions on the central vertical.
    You've got a perspective grid!
    If you want to add more lines
    to the grid, simply make more
    subdivisions and repeat.</figcaption>

<figure>
    <img src="images/brewer07.gif" alt="An object drawn using a perspective grid generated by the Brewer Method" />
<figcaption>The grid allows you to approximate the correct angle for any line by
    comparing it to the nearest grid lines. This won't be 100% accurate,
    but for most cases it will be good enough.</figcaption>
</figure>
    <p>
    It's not a bad idea to keep the grid on one sheet of paper and your
    drawing on another, using tracing paper or a lightbox. This way you
    won't have to erase the grid from your final drawing, plus you'll be
    able to also reuse grids and save time!</p>

<h3>What's the difference between these two techniques?</h3>
<p>Dividing is useful when you need a specific number of points to be cover a specific space. For example, if you were to draw the side of a building and
you want it to have a row of equally-sized windows, you would want to divide the length of the wall to find where the windows will go.</p>
<p>Multiplying is useful when you need to repeat an interval of space, but the exact length and number of repetitions doesn't matter. In our row of windows
example above, multiplying would not be an ideal solution, because you would need to use trial and error to find the exact width needed to make the edge of the
last window perfectly align with the far edge of the wall. However, if the far edge of the wall is beyond the edge of your composition, multiplication would probably
be a better choice!</p>
<p>In short: Multiplication is easier but harder to control. Division is more complicated, but gives you more specificity. One method is not better than the other,
but they have different applications. Start experimenting with them and you'll quickly understand when to use one or the other!</p>






<h2 id="orthographics">Orthographic Drawing</h2>
<div class="columnar">
    <div>
        <p>In orthographic drawings (also sometimes called <strong>paraline
    drawings</strong>), lines run parallel to each other and do not converge.
    In general, orthographic views use vertical lines for one axis, and
    specific diagonal angles for the other two axes.</p>

<p>The most common orthographic
    method is <strong>isometric</strong>, in which the
    two "side-to-side" axes are both
    set at 30&deg; from the horizontal.
    Isometric artwork has been widely
    used to create an illusion of depth
    in non-3D video games.</p>

    isometric view to depict an architecture
    classroom. Thematically appropriate!</figcaption>

<h3>To create an isometric grid:</h3>

          <img src="images/isometric03.gif" alt="Duplicating the diagonal lines to form the isometric grid"/>
<figcaption>Now duplicate the lines at regular
    intervals. I recommend a transparent
    grid ruler, or rotating the paper and
    using a T-square.</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </li>
</ol>



<p>Orthographic drawings have inherent clarity, which is why they are
    often used for diagrams and architectural plans. But this also makes
    them a good option for comics and illustration, where clarity is often
    more important than "realistic" perspective. Strangely, the technique is
    somewhat rare in comics, but it has a lot of potential. Try it!</p>

<h2 id="faking">Faking It</h2>
                 <p>Sometimes perspective just isn't worth the trouble. I'd like to introduce
    you to an interesting approach to this that's frequently employed by
    comics artists. It doesn't have an official name that I'm aware of, but
    you might call it "flat perspective." This drawing by Chris Ware (master
    of the form) is a good example of this technique.</p>
<div class="columnar">
    <div>


            <img src="images/ware01.gif" alt="A drawing by Chris Ware showing &quot;fake&quot; perspective"/>


    </div>
<div>
    <p>Objects in the distance are
    smaller, but they do not
    recede in a mathematically
    predictable way.</p>
<p>The orientation is an
    orthographic &frac34; view, which
    suggests a bit more depth
    than a head-on view would.</p>
<p>Foreground objects are
    emphasized with a heavier
    line, and are closer to the
    bottom of the composition.</p>
<p>The characters and the car
    both sit on a horizontal
    "ground line."</p>
<p>Below the ground line is a
    space that represents the
    surface of the ground.</p>
<p>This method is fascinating because it makes no logical sense, but it
    does make sense <strong>intuitively</strong>. Placing characters' feet on a horizontal
    line "feels right," even though this scene could never exist in actual
    space. These kinds of drawings are easy to read, and easy for the
    artist to construct: a perfect match for comics art!</p>

    <figcaption>Another example,
    from my own work.
    Notice that the floor
    is "sloped" to show
    texture but other
    flat surfaces (the TV
    table, the counter)
    are seen edge-on.</figcaption>

<h2 id="two_last">Two Last Things</h2>
<h3 id="atmospheric">Atmospheric Perspective</h3>
<p>Air is not completely transparent. Even on
    a clear day, distant objects appear slightly
    faded. Atmospheric perspective uses this
    effect as another way to convey depth.
    Fading out the background also serves to
    diminish its visual significance, making it less
    likely to distract the reader.</p>
<figure class="captioned_example">
    <img src="images/atmospheric.gif" alt="An example of atmospheric perspective from Acting Out by Ivy Lynn Allie"/>
    <figcaption>In this example from my own work, diminished
    line weight and white space instead of texture push the landscape into the distance.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="layers">Layers of Depth</h3>
<p>Consciously plan your compositions
    to have a foreground, middleground,
    and background. Multiple layers of
    depth always make a drawing more
    dynamic and interesting, and also
    offer some interesting possibilities for
    layout. Seen here is a breakdown
    of the Chris Ware drawing from the
    <a href="#faking">"Faking It" section</a> into four layers. Notice
    how the car is framed in the image
    both by the bush in the layer in front of
    it and by the fence in the layer behind
    it. Consider adding another layer of
    depth to your next drawing&mdash;I think
    you'll like the result!</p>

<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:decimal;">
    <li>Design a very simple building and then draw it a few different
        ways. Move the vanishing points around, try three-point, rotate it, do
        an isometric view! Do your best to keep its features consistent.
    </li>
    <li>Use the same vanishing point layout to draw an interior scene and
        an exterior scene. Note the ways in which they feel different even
        though the parameters are the same.
    </li>
    <li>Draw a wall in perspective and then add a row of regularly-
        spaced windows. There are multiple ways to do this. See how many
        you can think of.
    </li>
    <li>Invent your own system for representing depth! This is all artificial
        anyway so anything is valid so long as it makes sense to the viewer.
    </li>
    <li>Make up a complicated scene and commit to getting the
        perspective right. Pretty broad for an exercise, I know, but the best
        way to get the hang of this stuff is to do it a lot.
