<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>This story was produced in April 2020 as my "first year final project" at the Center for Cartoon Studies,
    White River Junction, Vermont. It was primarily inked with Ishikawa Zebra G and Tachikawa No. 5 Schoolpen nibs.
It was lettered with a ZIG 0.3 rollerball pen. Digital editing and image processing were performed with Krita and ImageMagick.</p>

<p><strong>Many thanks</strong> to the CCS staff and faculty, and to my esteemed colleagues in the classes of 2020 and 2021. I've learned things from
every one of you.</p>

<p>For their help with this particular project, I especially want to thank Ksenya Kouzminova, Lillie J. Harris, Emil Wilson,
Kevin Fitzpatrick, Jason Lutes, Stephen Bissette, Cuyler Hedlund, Luke Kruger-Howard, and Kori Handwerker.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Thanks for reading!</h3>
