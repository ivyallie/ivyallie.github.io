description: An adventure-drama webcomic about airships, by Ivy Allie
---
<p><em>Sunrise</em> was an episodic adventure-drama webcomic that took place on an airship. It began in 2008 and
ran through 2013 for a total of ten issues, and I'm pleased to say that it actually ended gracefully. Some of it is
pretty good, but I was a teenager when I began the first issue, so much of its early run is very, very rough. In my
own opinion it's not much good until issue 8.</p>
<p>All that being said, you can <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ro1pqxbq98n3b51/sunrise_complete.pdf">click here to download a complete PDF of the entire series</a>, over 350 pages of comics!
Or, alternatively, keep scrolling to see some samples. No skin off my nose either way!</p>
