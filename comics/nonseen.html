description: A webcomic by Ivy Allie about kids and invisible monsters
---
<p><em>The Non-Seen</em> was a webcomic that ran from 2014 - 2018, at which point it unceremoniously ended in the middle
of its fourth chapter. The story was about some kids who find a book that explains how to see invisible monsters,
and then, not surprisingly, things begin to go horribly wrong. Despite its early termination, it ran to over 150 pages
and some of it was pretty good. See some samples below, or
