description: Acting Out, an unfinished graphic novel by Ivy Lynn Allie
---
<p><em>Acting Out</em> was the primary component of my thesis project at The Center for Cartoon Studies (2021).
It will eventually be a 240-page graphic novel, but as of April 2021
it is a work in progress and is not available online.</p>
<p>However, here are a few selections from the book for your enjoyment.</p>
