<p><em>Mirror Neuron</em> No. 2 is the second issue of my solo comics anthology magazine (previously published as <em>Sanity Check</em>). It contains two original short stories and a variety of bonus features, a total of 44 pages of content.</p>

    <p>Print copies are currently not available, but you can still pay what you want (including $0, if you can't afford more)
        for a PDF on <a href="https://ivylynnallie.gumroad.com/l/MirrorNeuron2">Gumroad</a>. Print copies will next be available
    at the Small Press Expo in September 2022.</p>

    <p>Eventually the comic will also appear on this page for free, but the time is not yet ripe.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy reading <em>Mirror Neuron</em>.</p>

<h2>But don't take my word for it!</h2>

<blockquote>“I really tried to take it slow reading the latest issue of
    <em>Mirror Neuron</em>; I wanted to savor it this time. I failed
miserably. Ivy has a way of pulling you from cover to
cover against your best efforts. I think she might be
some sort of cartooning witch. Whatever, I’m going to
    go read it again.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Reading an Ivy Allie story is like
watching a really really good movie,
except better, because it’s comics.
Whether she’s drawing a giant flying
dog with glowing eyes or a sad boss
at a laser tag work party, her comics
shine with her inimitable voice, wit,
and insight.”</blockquote>

<h3>People liked the previous issue, too!</h3>
<blockquote>“Ivy Lynn Allie’s [...] short fiction
is exceptionally clever, subtle, and
unsettling, and her ability to effortlessly
cross genres mark her as someone who
can go in any direction as a cartoonist
    and do well. [<em>Mirror Neuron</em>] was one of
the better minicomics I read in 2020.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Fantastic first issue.”</blockquote>
