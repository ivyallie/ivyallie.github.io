<p><em>Mirror Neuron</em> No. 2 is the second issue of my solo comics anthology magazine (previously published as <em>Sanity Check</em>). It contains two original short stories and a variety of bonus features, a total of 44 pages of content. Print copies have been produced in a numbered edition of 100.</p>

<p>Perhaps best of all, until 30 April 2022, <em>Mirror Neuron</em> will be distributed on a not-for-profit model. If you can't afford to pay, you can still get a copy--just checkout below for $0. You will still receive both a print copy and a PDF. Each copy of <em>Mirror Neuron</em> costs about $8 to print and mail. If you can afford to, please consider paying that amount, or buy copies for strangers by paying more. Anyone who pays $8 or more will also receive a limited-edition print as a thank you from me.</p>

<p><b>I believe that everyone deserves access to art. If you agree, please consider chipping in to cover the costs for those who can't.</b> We're all in this together, so let's be kind to each other. &#9829;</p>

<p>After 30 April, the cost of a copy will be $12 &mdash; assuming there are any left!</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy reading <em>Mirror Neuron</em>.</p>

    <p>(Note: Currently I am only able to ship print copies within the United States, but if you live elsewhere, you can still get the PDF!)</p>

<blockquote>“I really tried to take it slow reading the latest issue of
    <em>Mirror Neuron</em>; I wanted to savor it this time. I failed
miserably. Ivy has a way of pulling you from cover to
cover against your best efforts. I think she might be
some sort of cartooning witch. Whatever, I’m going to
    go read it again.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Reading an Ivy Allie story is like
watching a really really good movie,
except better, because it’s comics.
Whether she’s drawing a giant flying
dog with glowing eyes or a sad boss
at a laser tag work party, her comics
shine with her inimitable voice, wit,
and insight.”</blockquote>

<h3>People liked the previous issue, too!</h3>
<blockquote>“Ivy Lynn Allie’s [...] short fiction
is exceptionally clever, subtle, and
unsettling, and her ability to effortlessly
cross genres mark her as someone who
can go in any direction as a cartoonist
    and do well. [<em>Mirror Neuron</em>] was one of
the better minicomics I read in 2020.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Fantastic first issue.”</blockquote>

<h3>FAQs</h3>
<div class="no-indent">
<p class="no-indent"><strong>Can I really get a print copy for free?</strong><br/>Yes, as long as you live within the US! Just go to the order form and enter $0.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><strong>Really?</strong><br/>Yes.</p>
    <p><strong>Are you going to harvest my email address and send me spam?</strong><br/>Absolutely not. You may receive emails
    from Gumroad directly pertaining to your order, but you won't get any from me. I'm not going to keep your address on file
    or sign you up for a newsletter.</p>

    <p><strong>What if I live outside the US and I want a print copy?</strong><br/>Email me and we'll discuss it. Due to the expense of international
    shipping I can't foot the bill, but if you're willing to cover that cost I would still be happy to send you a copy.</p>

    <p><strong>I don't want to use Gumroad.</strong><br/>Email me and we'll work something out.</p>
