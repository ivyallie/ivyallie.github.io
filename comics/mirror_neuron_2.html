<h2>Praise for Issue 2</h2>
<div>
<blockquote>“I really tried to take it slow reading the latest issue of
    <em>Mirror Neuron</em>; I wanted to savor it this time. I failed
miserably. Ivy has a way of pulling you from cover to
cover against your best efforts. I think she might be
some sort of cartooning witch. Whatever, I’m going to
    go read it again.”</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0;"><b>LUKE KRUGER-HOWARD</b><br/>author of <em>Our Mother</em> (Retrofit/Big Planet), Goes Books</p>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote>“Reading an Ivy Allie story is like
watching a really really good movie,
except better, because it’s comics.
Whether she’s drawing a giant flying
dog with glowing eyes or a sad boss
at a laser tag work party, her comics
shine with her inimitable voice, wit,
and insight.”</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center; text-indent:0;"><b>DARYL SEITCHIK</b><br/>author of <em>Missy</em>, <em>EXITS</em></p>
    </div>
<div>
<blockquote>"Allie's harsh, funny slice-of-life stories have quickly vaulted her into the upper tier of CCS grads, especially as her confidence in her line has grown. She's staking out her own territory, to be sure, but it's the kind of thing that Sean Knickerbocker, Tillie Walden, and especially Dakota McFadzean do so well. Allie conjures up sad, ugly, and desperate lives where rewards are few and justice isn't always fair."</blockquote>
