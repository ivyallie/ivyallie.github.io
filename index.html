<h2>What's good around here?</h2>
<p>The best stuff is my <a href="/comics/">comics</a>; I'd start there. After that maybe check out some <a href="/words/">writing</a>
or maybe my <a href="/pictures/">art portfolio</a>. There are also my <a href="/dev/">software dev</a> projects if you're into that kind of thing.
But if you're only here for <a href="/calculator/">the Cartoonist's Calculator</a>, that's OK too :).</p>

        <p>I'm Ivy! I'm a cartoonist and writer, currently living in Los Angeles.
            I'm an alumna of the Center for Cartoon Studies class of 2021.</p>
                       <p>Outside of my art I work professionally in computer graphics and software development.</p>

        <p>I mostly keep off of social media but you can find me rambling about movies on <a href="https://letterboxd.com/ivyallie/">Letterboxd</a>
            and also on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ivylynnallie/">Instagram</a> if that's your thing.</p>
