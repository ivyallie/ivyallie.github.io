<p>The debut issue of what will hopefully become an ongoing publication, <em>Sanity Check 1</em> includes
two original short stories in over 25 pages of comics, plus a variety of bonus material. The first story,
"Of Course, No One Knew", is about the memory of a distant summer dredged up by a DVD commentary. The second
story, "The Situation," is about a toad exterminator in suburban Florida who's faced with an ethical predicament.</p>
<p>As of this writing, the comics are not available for free yet, but they can be obtained for as little as $8
    via <a href="https://gum.co/WShNi">Gumroad</a>. Profits benefit the ACLU Foundation.</p>
<p>Or you can wait and eventually I'll probably post it for free. In the meantime, have some previews:</p>
