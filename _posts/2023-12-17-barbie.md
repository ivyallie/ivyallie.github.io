*Barbie* appears to me to be one of the most cynically calculated works
of art ever created. Judging solely from the discourse surrounding it,
(sanctioned and otherwise) it appears to have been intentionally engineered
to have wide appeal and head off potential criticism in service of
rehabilitating a tainted brand for the long term and making a tidy profit for
Mattel in the short term. Naturally, this is not the first attempt to use
Hollywood to further such goals, but what frightens me about *Barbie* is how 
successful it has been.

Barbie, the brand, has long been the subject of harsh criticism from
feminists, who have accused it of causing body image issues, glorifying consumerism,
providing poor role models, and so on. I'm not here to argue any of these
points, but neither am I here to argue against any of them. Barbie is,
as it always has been and always will be, foremost a consumer product, a
hunk of plastic that exists as a commodity to be bought. Mattel doesn't
care if feminists think Barbie is a bad role model unless those
criticisms lead to a decline in Barbie's sales. And, to be clear,
Barbie's sales have been declining. [As of 2016, sales of the brand
were at an "all-time low" and, as the press interpreted it, Mattel was
having a hard time keeping it
"relevant."](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/09/there-may-be-no-one-at-barbies-birthday-party.html)
Whether this was due to feminist criticism or to unrelated market forces
is hard to say, although I would venture to guess it was a mix of both.

Mattel clearly thought so too: the *Barbie* movie, as a rehabilitation
tactic, took aim both at the feminist criticisms and the cultural
irrelevancy.

It's been obvious from the start that Mattel has wanted this to be seen
as a feminist movie. Attaching Greta Gerwig to the project is a clear
enough sign of that. And much of the discourse around this film since
its release has been related to feminism, and whether or not it's
successful at making some sort of feminist statement. 

I argue that it is 
impossible for this kind of film
to be unequivocally feminist, especially not in the contemporary intersectional sense.
Regardless of what statement Gerwig et al.
are *trying* to make here, you cannot make a philosophically consistent
argument for feminism in a product that also functions as a commercial
for an international toy conglomerate.

This is because Mattel is not, and can never be, a bastion of feminism.
It is a legacy corporation, one worth billions of dollars, and is built
on a foundation of greed and suffering. It's been known for years that
Barbies, and most other Mattel products, are produced for low wages
under hazardous conditions in factories throughout the global South.
Many of the workers in these factories are women, and [Mattel has
consistently denied or ignored reports that find them to be hotbeds of
sexual
harassment.](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/china-ngo-report-reveals-barbie-making-female-workers-in-mattel-groups-factory-are-exposed-to-risks-of-sexual-harassment/)
Additionally, Mattel, being first and foremost a purveyor of plastic
gewgaws, is unavoidably a contributor to the plastic waste that is
befouling our planet and&mdash;go figure&mdash;[having an outsized effect on
women in poor
countries.](https://theconversation.com/plastic-waste-is-hurting-women-in-developing-countries-but-there-are-ways-to-stop-it-166596)
To support feminism, Mattel would have to become something other than
Mattel. The old disclaimer still applies: the views and opinions of the
filmmakers do not reflect those of the company.

Of course, the film does not let Mattel off the hook
entirely. In fact it addresses Mattel very explicitly, depicting its CEO
as a buffoon in what is clearly meant as a light criticism of the
corporation's dubious intentions. But this also serves to obscure the
fact that the CEO of Mattel is a real guy, one whose intentions with
Barbie are every bit as questionable as those of anyone who came before
him. His name is Ynon Kreiz, and he has not been at all subtle about
what the *Barbie* movie was supposed to do: ["This was not about making
a movie. This was about creating a cultural event that will reach,
engage, and touch consumers all over the
world."](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/07/barbie-movie-interview-mattel-ceo-ynon-kreiz)
Note the telling use of the word *consumers* there. This was not about
"reaching, engaging, and touching" people more generally, it was about
talking to the people who are likely to buy things, and telling them
that what they ought to be buying is Barbie.

Regarding his depiction in the film, Kreiz said simply that Mattel
"embrace\[s\] self-deprecation." Naturally: recent years have proven
quite definitively that corporations like Mattel can have their cake and
eat it too. They've learned that people no longer appreciate corporations
that comport themselves like stuffy authority figures, we prefer
corporations that act like our pals. That means PR offices making snarky
comments on Twitter, it means CEOs who dress like teenagers, it means
rainbow-colored pablum every June. And in 2023, corporations realized that 
they can take direct potshots at themselves
and reap rewards for doing so, as Netflix has done in [a recent Black
Mirror
episode](https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/6/23/23770239/black-mirror-joan-is-awful-review-ai-annie-murphy-salma-hayek).
It is now a viable marketing strategy to stand up and say "hey, we suck,
don't we?" and get an appreciative laugh from the audience. If
self-deprecation is more likable than maintaining an air of superiority,
of course they're going to do it.

So if the problem is that Barbie is no longer culturally relevant, what
tactic did the movie take to make it culturally relevant again?
Essentially, they tied it to a larger cultural phenomenon: camp. Camp
has been with us for a long time (Susan Sontag's seminal essay on the
topic was published in 1964), but the increased popularity of the
phenomenon has recently run the gamut from high to low culture, from TV
drag competitions to the hallowed halls of the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, camp becoming more culturally relevant at the same time that
Barbie's popularity was on the wane. The pairing of Barbie with
deliberate camp was a natural one: Barbie has always been campy, with
its bright pink trappings and its emphasis on fashion. It's hard to
imagine any other current cultural trend that would have been a more
convenient vehicle for Barbie's return to relevancy.

However, I would argue that Barbie is not *doing* camp so much as it's
*appropriating* it. Camp has always been inextricably linked to gay
culture, to the extent that it's almost impossible to discuss one
without discussing the other. Granted, no group can claim exclusive
ownership over an aesthetic, but is this not a form of cultural
appropriation? Greta Gerwig isn't gay. Margot Robbie isn't gay. Ynon
Kreiz isn't gay. Mattel sure as hell isn't gay. I won't claim that no 
queer people worked on this film (which would be absurd),
but the major stakeholders and decision-makers involved were not. This
is a film made by straight people that was designed to capitalize on a
trend created by queer people. 

And did it ever work: a veritable
waterfall of bright pink money for its creators, very little of which is
going to find its way back into the pockets of the queer people who
pioneered the style. Regardless of how Mattel wants to position itself
in terms of its relationship to queer people (and to be fair, it has a
[somewhat better track record than many large corporations](https://brands.choosebecause.com/mattel/lgbtq-rights/)), it's
important to remember that it does *not* exist to be anybody's friend.
They make "gay stuff" if they think people are interested in buying gay
stuff.

The integration of camp is just one aspect of the film's larger strategy
toward being universally appealing, however. The first thing that I
found alarming about *Barbie*, before I thought about any of this, was
the way that it seemed deliberately (and very effectively) engineered to
have the broadest appeal possible. This is a strategy that film studios
seem to be getting increasingly adept at, and I find their success
deeply unsettling. It's akin to other forms of social engineering like
the casino or the con man, systems which exploit quirks of human psychology
as a hacker exploits a software bug.

This "universal appeal" is attained by building up the film in such a
way as to appeal to broadly different demographics whose interests
wouldn't normally overlap much. We've got the camp aspect to bring in
the queer people and aesthetes. We've got Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach
to bring in the cinephiles, who normally wouldn't show up for this kind
of corporate production. This also loops back and ushers the film into
"critical darling" territory, which is useful for drawing in the more
casual moviegoers for whom Rotten Tomatoes is the final word. We've got
the trappings of feminism to draw in the NPR-liberal demographic (which
conveniently also sells tickets to the Ben Shapiros of the world, who
will watch anything if they think they can make culture-war fodder from
it). Including Margot Robbie brings in her substantial fanbase, a
significant percentage of which are also the highly lucrative superhero
fans. Then there's the nostalgia aspect for the many, many people for
whom Barbie is associated with fond childhood memories. If you get
enough momentum behind the marketing (and [Mattel spent $150 million
marketing this
baby](https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/barbie-was-a-marketing-masterpiece-heres-why)),
you can even start getting straight men into the seats, whether they
come out of curiosity or because a female partner dragged them into it.

Finally, you also get children. With a rating of PG-13, the movie isn't
meant for them on paper, but obviously a lot of them are going to see it
anyway, and you can bet that Mattel is well aware of this. The *Jurassic
World* films are rated PG-13 as well, and Mattel makes [tie-in toys for
those](https://shop.mattel.com/collections/jurassic-world).
Much ink has been spilled to the effect that *Barbie* is a film meant
for adults, but it's not meant for adults, not exactly. *Barbie* is a
film meant to be fun for the whole family, as the old cliche goes. But
where this usually means "fun primarily for children, and more or less
tolerated by adults," here it's the opposite. Mattel knows kids will see
this movie. They expect and want kids to see it. And they're hoping that
said kids will like it at least enough to beg for more pink plastic crap
come Christmas (and presumably grow up to be the next generation of
Barbie-loving adults). Regardless of what else it has become, and what
so many people want to believe, *Barbie* is still a toy commercial, and
always has been.

And even as the film sells toys to kids, as per tradition, *Barbie* is
also the harbinger of Mattel's pivot from being a purveyor of childhood
playthings to being a company that profits off of its intellectual
property. This is the company's [stated
goal](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/mattel-disney-executive-josh-silverman-ip-1235166156/),
according to recently-hired executive Josh Silverman, formerly of
Disney. *Barbie* is merely the beginning of a slew of branded media
franchises that they plan to unleash on the public. Films based on *Hot
Wheels* and *Monopoly* sound idiotic now, but *Barbie* would have
sounded just as silly before it became a phenomenon. I see no reason to
think that they won't be able to find equally compelling justifications
for these films. *Hot Wheels* is already "revving its engine," so to
speak, with producer J.J. Abrams (an experienced reinvigorator of tired
properties) saying that the film will be ["emotional and grounded
and
gritty."](https://movieweb.com/jj-abrams-grounded-hot-wheels/)
Of course. It'll have a script that's just good enough for it to be
better than people expect it to be, it'll have some star with a cult
following, it'll have a slightly surprising hook, and a message just to
the left of centrism. These people know exactly what they're doing, and
so far they've done it very well.

Before *Barbie* was released, when it wasn't yet clear whether we had a
*bona fide* cultural phenomenon on our hands, I predicted that it would
be one of the most significant works of art in recent memory. I felt
insane as I said it, but the film's reception has not led me to think
otherwise. The *Barbie* phenomenon is deeply disturbing to me, perhaps
the most thorough and effective fusion of commercialism and culture that
I've ever seen. All big-name films sell merchandise, of course, but it's
rare to see something that is so *transparently* an advertisement be
wholeheartedly embraced by people as a cultural treasure in its own
right.

I have no doubt that some of *Barbie*'s fans, reading what I have
written here, will want to rush to the film's defense, and charge that
the film is *more* than an advertisement, that it's just a good and fun
movie. Maybe so. But if anything, that makes it worse. *Barbie* has
shown that you can wrap a commercial in a veneer of cultural legitimacy,
and that you can make unfathomable amounts of money doing so. The same
formula that saw Saturday morning cartoons reduced to toy commercials in
the 80s has come for cinema, but now it's been optimized for
grownups&mdash;including the kind of grownups who think they're beyond this
kind of pandering. It's a wolf in sheep's clothing, a Trojan horse. A
spoonful of sugar that makes the medicine go down. They've found a way
to make us pay to watch commercials and go home swearing that we enjoyed
it. If that doesn't scare you, I don't know what would.
