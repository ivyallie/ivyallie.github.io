Possibly the most fascinating and vivid new art form of our time, nearly
everyone I know under the age of 40 watches video essays on at least a 
semi-regular basis. The best of them are as well-made, sophisticated, interesting,
and insightful as anything that might get nominated for established awards.
Yet so far there's been very little recognition of the form outside of the 
potent enthusiasm of its audience. So I thought it might be fun to compile a list
of some of the video essays that I most enjoyed this year. This is not a ranking,
nor is it an award, nor is it comprehensive. Consider it a list of recommendations.

I've also made a [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1uMHnggXlRbyEP26P6V57qhBAr6jSiHC) for your convenience.

## Internet culture
- [What The Internet Did to Garfield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2C5R3FOWdE) by Super Eyepatch Wolf. Why is the internet fixated on the Fat Cat? And why does that fixation so often manifest in dark and grim ways? An excellent look at the history of online Garfield fandom, participatory art, and the surprising themes of Jim Davis's own creation.
- [The Lost Film About Internet Memes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRj90zkzjtw) by Lady Emily. What happened when a bunch of then-popular internet personalities decided to make a feature film about themselves? Not a whole lot, apparently.
- ["Michaelsoft Binbows" isn't what you think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDzAAjzbV5g) by Nick Robinson. The surprisingly heartwarming story of one man's search for the origin of a silly picture he saw on the internet once. 

### The Ballad of Doug Walker
There was a lot of good discussion this year about my favorite disgraced Internet celebrity, Doug "The Nostalgia Critic" Walker. [Full playlist here.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1uMHnggXlRY00tEA2_0tsOTLlNzqh8bD)

- [The Failure of Channel Awesome's Demo Reel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFIlUa6WYuM) by Lady Emily. In which Doug attempts to start a new
career as the show runner of a serial comedy-drama and creates something truly bizarre and awful.
- [The Nostalgia Critic and The Wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rokAtlFGa7Y) by Folding Ideas. In which Doug attempts to write a love letter
to Pink Floyd's _The Wall_ and accidentally creates a feature-length mockery of it.
- [The Review Must Go On - Doug Walker's Haunting Masterpiece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E03h-3GweNc) by Diregentleman. In which Doug attempts to
quit his job and fails.
- [Doug Walker's "The Review Must Go On" Sucks, Too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T72bPwHnPxQ) by droowpy. In which Doug's adventures in the previous
essay require even further exploration.
- [Nostalgia Critic Reviews AREN'T Reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUz2f-A9Oqw&t=0s) by Bright Side Euan. In which Doug attempts film criticism,
and creates a legacy of bad film criticism in his wake.


## Video games
- [Exposing Fraud and Deception in the Retro Video Game Market](https://youtu.be/rvLFEh7V18A) by Karl Jobst. An infuriating and thorough 
look at the world of vintage video game collecting that details the wide-ranging grift of the collecting world in general. 
- [How Cities: Skylines Makes You Plan Bad Cities](https://youtu.be/Fy672b7xZ6c) by Pres. I've enjoyed this game but like most city-builder
games, the cities it encourages you to build are not necessarily cities that would be good places in real life. And Here's Why.
- [Unboxing the hidden politics of SimCity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_51_YJQpeg0) by Polygon. Even more discussion of the subtexts of city-builder games!

sacrifice as a gameplay mechanic. 
- [Should Games Be Frustrating?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMNTNDRcQJI) by Razbuten. 
- [Open-World Games Are A Mess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSQxx40mpoA) by yakkocmn. I have a lot of complaints about video games
in general, and this video felt like I could have written it myself. 
- [Designing Dark Souls Easy Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU_PFD_R1Ww) by Darkfry. _Dark Souls_, the game best-known for being
intentionally difficult to play, is here the subject of an interesting question: how could you make _Dark Souls_ easy while staying true to its intent?
- [The Game Prototype That Had To Be Banned By Its Own Studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOYbR-Q_4Hs) by People Make Games. An interesting
story about a game idea that proved to be a kind of psychological hazard. 
- [Just how bad is The Combine?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5Qdu7b6eGs&t=982s) by Leadhead. I played _Half-Life 2_ but somehow I missed
a lot of the backstory nuance that is explained in this video. And you probably did, too.
- [The Hidden Game Within Microsoft Flight Simulator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulVfzB2tiMU) by Writing on Games. 
The strange beauty of playing MS Flight Sim wrong.


## Urban Planning

concepts of good city design through the lens of Houston getting it wrong.

big-box shopping districts are actually called, and why they're a blight.
- [The HyperPort is Dumb and Will Most Likely Explode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNzjk-kiUmQ) A snarky takedown of an Elon-Musk-esque 
"disruption" technology for cargo terminals.

## Film and Televison
- [That Time A Dollar Store Made a Game Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwulEe3Tmz4) by Lady Emily. Did you know Family Dollar
once made its own branded game show? They did! And here is more information about it than anyone in their right mind ever wanted to know.
- The "Reality TV Chronicles" by We're in Hell. A rich and surprising exploration of the context and subtexts of some of recent memory's weirdest reality shows.
    - [Why Are Cooking Shows?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i3zKU8Q6ZI)

- [Love Never Dies: A Magnificent Trashfire Sequel to Phantom of the Opera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfz-_WxGu3Y) by Lindsay Ellis. If you're reading this
at all then I don't imagine Lindsay Ellis needs further explanation. 
- [Love Island: A Flirtation With Surveillance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8VqPxYM2tY) by Broey Deschanel. In case you needed even more videos about
surveillance in the context of dating shows.

- [An Exhaustive History of Ralph Bakshi's Lord of the Rings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cr_rb_pitHk) by Folding Ideas.
- [Stripping the Layers of Sensual Dancing in Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSHBrCPhCfk) by Broey Deschanel. OK, if you learn anything
from my list it's that Broey Deschanel is probably the best video essayist writing about film right now. Just go watch one of her videos, they're all good.
- [The Problem of Method Acting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVWGyuBFgzw) by Broey Deschanel.
- The "Saurian Cinema" series by coldcrashpictures. A great series presenting various perspectives on dinosaur movies. 
Not dissimilar to Lindsay Ellis's _Transformers_ series from several years ago. The first two technically came out in 2020, but who's counting.
    - [Gender and Jurassic Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hCuv16pzjs)

without Jar-Jar Binks and _The Thief and the Cobbler_ are just the beginning.
- [Stock Music and Reality TV: How to Misrepresent the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G77ev9pks4I) by Tantacrul. Reality TV was a big
topic in video essaying this year, wasn't it? This one is specifically about how these shows use music to create narratives that may not actually exist.
- [Capitalism, Poverty, and Ratatouille](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC2gRvG1RlI) by The Sin Squad. All about _Ratatouille_'s strange obsession
with theft as the ultimate crime. Technically came out before 2021, but only by a day so I'll allow it.

### The Sia Saga
The most fascinating and horrifying event in 2021 cinema was the release of the ill-advised autism film "Music", created by ostensibly famous
musician Sia. (Had you heard of her before this debacle? Because I hadn't.) I can't remember which of the many videos about it that I watched was best,
so here are a couple different ones.
- [Sia's Movie: Another Autistic's Response Because Y'all Won't Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMWdA-Xif7I) by tianoso. 
- [Sia's Music: The Trap of Symbolic Autistic Representation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=138y6mtgll8) by Jessie Gender.



## Computers and Programming
- [The REAL Story on Why Space Cadet Pinball Was Removed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EPTfOTC4Jw) by NCommander. Why did Microsoft remove Space Cadet Pinball from Windows?
And why did they lie about it? And can we get it to run on a modern OS? 
- [A Brief Introduction to Esoteric Programming Languages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ7bcCrJMHc) by Hillel Wayne.
The art and science of weird, incredibly specific programming languages.

packed an entire 3D game into 96KB.
- [The Typographic Legacy of Microsoft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LndgfGjGImw) by Linus Boman. From Arial and Georgia to Trebuchet and Comic Sans,
Microsoft's typography has become as pervasive as plastic in today's world. This is a great overview of the typefaces Microsoft has created and their outsize
influence on graphic design.
- [Bliss - The Story of Windows XP's Famous Default Wallpaper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_rildi0Izs) by Michael MJD. A surprisingly
touching and heartfelt homage to the history and legacy of the green hills that appeared in (arguably) the most famous photograph of all time.

## Miscellaneous

- [White Trash and The Politics of Food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNvQQhymT8o&t=1s) by Zoe Bee. The sociology of "trashy" foods and what they mean.
- [Vaccines: A Measured Response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BIcAZxFfrc) by hbomberguy. If you've been watching video essays for a while,
then you know hbomberguy is a name to wait for with giddy anticipation. He did not disappoint with this year's epic, which is the most detailed
and bizarre history of antivax progenitor Andrew Wakefield and his legacy that I've seen so far.

strangely fascinating videos of the year.

Strange, chilling, and poetic.

foods that you'd be hard-pressed to find anywhere in America. (You'd be hard-pressed to find an American even willing to eat them, probably.)

and the beauty industry.
