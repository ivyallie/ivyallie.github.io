Now's your chance to get original art of your favorite movie and support charity at the same time! For your donation,
I will create an illustration
based on a film still of your choice, and all proceeds will go to [Doctors Without Borders](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/).
Doctors Without Borders is an international aid organization that supplies medical care in the places where it's most needed.
After two years of pandemic, I think we can all appreciate how important such work is right now. So don't be shy, hop on board
 and let's get this show on the road! 
 
## Pricing
- $20 (or more) for a black-and-white illustration
- $40 (or more) for a full-color illustration

## What you'll get
You will receive a high-resolution digital file suitable for printing. If desired I can also include a low-resolution version 
suitable for digital use.

## Disclaimer
The illustration you receive is for **personal use only**. Reselling the image in any way would constitute a copyright violation
both of the illustration itself and the intellectual property of the original film. The image upon which the illustration 
is based remains property of its respective owner.

## Let's do this!
Great! [Send me the funds via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/ivyallie) along with the name of the movie you'd like 
me to illustrate. I will contact you by email to confirm your order and at that time you can direct me to an image to use as the 
basis of the illustration.

The fundraiser will end on December 10th or when I can no longer accept any more requests, whichever comes first. The funds
will be donated to Doctors Without Borders as a lump sum on December 15th. In the interest of transparency, I will post a
full accounting of the funds on this page once the fundraiser is over.
