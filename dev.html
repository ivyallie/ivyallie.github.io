<p>Some of my software development projects.</p>
<div>
    <h3>Lucaflect</h3>
    <p>This is a complete CMS built in Flask. It's designed to serve online comics in a
    "magazine" format, much like <em>The Nib</em> and similar websites. It supports multiple users,
    the ability to post comics as "infinite canvas" or with page turns (preloading the next page while you read),
    and the compilation of posted comics into "collections." Python backend with a whole lotta JavaScript on the
    front end. It's been successfully deployed to Google App Engine. Open source under MIT license.</p>

    <h3>KritaPy</h3>
    <p>The beginnings of what will maybe eventually be a complete Python library for working with Krita .kra
    files. At the moment its only function is to extract a flattened image from the file and export it to a
    different format, but that's pretty useful still!</p>

    <h3>The Cartoonist's Calculator</h3>
    <p>A collection of small JavaScript utilities designed to streamline some common calculations
    needed by cartoonists.</p>

    <h3>This website</h3>
    <p>This here website that you're looking at right now was all built from scratch in artisanal hand-crafted
        HTML and CSS, and is generated
    with Jekyll.</p>

    <h3>Not appearing</h3>
    <p>Code written for my job is not available here, but includes a large number of Python scripts,
        mostly designed to expedite complicated procedures within Blender. I have also designed and developed
    static websites and WordPress themes for numerous freelance clients.</p>
