Much of the internet today is infested with pernicious JavaScript,
most of it designed to serve advertising, harvest data about you,
or both. This is bad for the user and even for the internet itself,
often making it impossible for websites to be archived and indexed,
and impeding their use over slow connections.

This site uses JavaScript, but only for a few very specific uses, 
detailed below. But I want to be emphatic on one point: **this website
is not spying on you.** The vast majority of other websites are, in one
way or another. But not this one, my friend. It doesn't even have a hit
counter. This site exists for one purpose and one purpose only: to show
you some things I made.

In the interest of transparency, here are the ways it uses JavaScript:

## How this site uses JavaScript

- To switch stylesheets in order to enable night reading mode.

- To substitute the navigation bar for a "hamburger" menu on small screens.

- To obfuscate my email address to discourage spambots from harvesting it.

- For improved navigation in some of my comics (specifically, pre-loading pages).

- To power [The Cartoonist's Calculator](/calculator/) and the [sketchbook prompt generator](/sketchbook_prompts).

- To enable the "fireplace puzzle" for [Myst in Retrospect](/myst/).

- It's possible there is some other use of it somewhere that I'm forgetting, but I promise it's something equally innocuous.

## This site does not and will not

- Collect information about you or your interactions with it

- Send said information to me or to corporations

- Open popups to hassle you about joining a newsletter

- Waste bandwidth with superfluous data (e.g., large JavaScript libraries, ads, etc.)

## My invitation to you

Let's all work together to create a new Web on the foundations of the old one. It was good, once, and it can be good
again. But only if we discard the practices that made it bad, and start over afresh. Now go build yourself a weird
personal website.
